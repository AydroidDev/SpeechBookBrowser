<span class="text_line" >In the early summer of 2004, I got a phone call from Steve Jobs.</span><br>
<span class="text_line" >He had been scattershot friendly to me over the years, with occa-</span><br>
<span class="text_line" >sional bursts of intensity, especially when he was launching a</span><br>
<span class="text_line" >new product that he wanted on the cover of Time or featured on</span><br>
<span class="text_line" >CNN, places where I’d worked. But now that I was no longer at</span><br>
<span class="text_line" >either of those places, I hadn’t heard from him much. We talked</span><br>
<span class="text_line" >a bit about the Aspen Institute, which I had recently joined, and I</span><br>
<span class="text_line" >invited him to speak at our summer campus in Colorado. He’d</span><br>
<span class="text_line" >be happy to come, he said, but not to be onstage. He wanted in-</span><br>
<span class="text_line" >stead to take a walk so that we could talk.</span><br>
